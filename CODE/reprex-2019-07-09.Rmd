Here is a simplified representation of a transformation that I need to apply to a large complex table. Here, the input table is a lookup with two numeric columns. `raw` has a many-to-one relationship with `SS`. Many values of `raw` can have the same value of of `SS`, but not vice-versa.


```
library(tidyverse)
input <- tribble(
  ~raw,	~SS,
  0, 75,
  1,	78,
  2,	80,
  3,	83,
  4,	83,
  5,	83,
  6,	90,
  7,	93,
  8,	95,
  9,	98
)
```
The desired output table is below.

```
output <- tribble(
  ~SS, ~raw,
  100, '-',
  99, '-',
  98, '9',
  97, '-',
  96, '-',
  95, '8',
  94, '-',
  93, '7',
  92, '-',
  91, '-',
  90, '6',
  89, '-',
  88, '-',
  87, '-',
  86, '-',
  85, '-',
  84, '-',
  83, '3-5',
  82, '-',
  81, '-',
  80, '2',
  79, '-',
  78, '1',
  77, '-',
  76, '-',
  75, '0',
  74, '-',
  73, '-',
  72, '-',
  71, '-',
  70, '-'
)
```

To create this output, the input needs to be transformed in several ways:
1. columns reordered
2. `SS` column filled out (100:70) and sorted descending
3. `raw` column coerced to character, with three types of values to preserve many-to-one relationship of raw-SS:
  a. a dash '-' for values of `SS` with no corresponding value of `raw` (e.g., SS = 70)
  b. a single value (e.g., '2') for values of `SS` with a single corresponding value of `raw` (e.g., SS = 80)
  c. a range of values (e.g., '3-5') for values of `SS` with multiple corresponding values of `raw` (e.g., SS = 83)

Here's how far I've gotten with it:

```
interim <- input %>% select(
  SS, raw
    ) %>% 
  mutate_at(
    vars(
      raw
      ), ~ as.character(.x)
    ) %>% 
  complete(
      SS = 70:100
      ) %>% 
  arrange(
      desc(
        SS
        )
      ) %>% 
  mutate_at(
    vars(
      raw
    ), ~ case_when(
      is.na(.x) ~ '-',
      TRUE ~ .x
    )
  )
```
If you run the above code, you'll see that the only remaining transformation  is to collapse the three `SS` = 83 rows into one, with a corresponding `raw` value of `3-5`. That means somehow recognizing that 3 and 5 are the lower and upper bounds of a range, because the solution will need to handle ranges of consecutive integers of indeterminate length.

Thanks in advance for any help!
